Question 1: What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors.
Ans: A CSS selector is a pattern used to select HTML elements you want to style.
        Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type.
        Example: p { color: blue; }

        Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
        Example: .highlight { background-color: yellow; }

        ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific ID.
        Example: #header { font-size: 24px; }

Question 2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles get resolved?
Ans: CSS specificity determines which style rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. It is calculated based on:
    Inline styles (highest specificity)
    ID selectors
    Class selectors, attributes, pseudo-classes
    Element selectors and pseudo-elements
    Conflicts are resolved by applying the rule with the highest specificity. If specificity is equal, the last declared rule in the stylesheet is applied.

Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS?
Ans: Inline CSS: Written inside the HTML element using the style attribute.
    Example: <p style="color:red;">
    Pros: Quick to apply.
    Cons: Not reusable, clutters HTML.
